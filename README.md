### Commit Standards

This project uses Conventional Commits specification for commit messages. The commit messages should be structured as follows:  

\<type>: \<description>  

Where type says the purpose of the commit and description is a simple summary of the changes that were made. Below are categorized some commit types:

**fix:** The fix type patches a bug in the code.
**feat:** Use this type for introducing new features.
**docs:** For new documentation or doc updates.
**refactor:** Neither a feat or a fix, use this if you just removed code smells for example.
